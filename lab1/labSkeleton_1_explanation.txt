To solve this first problem we declared a turn_mutex and an int turn to keep track of each philosphers turn to eat since only one should attempt to eat a time.
So using these variables for each diner we let one eat at time not allowing the others to eat, till the previous one was done. This was done by keeping track of whose turn it was in that int turn variable, and locking the turn mutex before checking if the current diner was the correct one. If it is their turn we unlock the turn mutex allowing that philospher to eat. This is repeated till they have all eaten in order 5 times.
